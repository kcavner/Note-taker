# Note-taker

## description
- this is an app to save and delete notes taken on a web interface created with express and node js backend technologies.

## details
- The server is created with express js and it has api endpoints with get and post http requests. The get requests read the json database and the post requests read and write to the database.

## what i learned
- I learned more about the process of transfer of data from api endpoints and the fs module. The request and response objects were also a bit tough to understand and handle in the callback functions of the endpoints. I learned that the methods they have on them can be very useful like making sure the json body has certain parameters or looking for a specific id in the body of the request before you send a response.
